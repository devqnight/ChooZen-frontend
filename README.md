Written in react-native.

## Dependencies

To run the expo project you'll need:
- a recent version of `nodejs` (recommended LTS 16)
- [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli)

## Run the project

Open a terminal to run the following commands.

Clone the repository:
> ```bash
>   git clone https://github.com/Night4dead/ChooZen-frontend
>```

Then move into the directory:
>```bash

Before running expo, you need to install the different packages, run this command:
